# EDA of Telco Customer Churn

## Project Overview
This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights related to customer churn, helping the company formulate effective customer retention strategies.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the project repository:
```
git clone <repository-url>
```
2. It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies effectively:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3. Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After setting up, you can start the Jupyter Notebook to run the analysis:

```
jupyter notebook
```
Navigate to the `EDA.ipynb` notebook in the Jupyter Notebook interface and execute the cells to see the analysis.

## Key Findings
- The analysis identifies crucial factors influencing customer churn, including contract type, billing methods, and usage of service features.
- Through data cleaning and visualization, deep insights into customer behaviors and patterns were extracted.
- The project demonstrates how statistical analysis can pinpoint customer segments with higher churn rates, guiding more effective retention efforts.
