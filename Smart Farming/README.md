# Crop Recommendation System

## Overview
This Crop Recommendation System leverages machine learning to offer precise, data-driven recommendations for farmers on which crops to plant, considering the specific soil properties and environmental conditions. It aims to optimize agricultural productivity and sustainability through predictive analytics.

## Features
- Analysis of soil properties (N, P, K ratios) and environmental factors (temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall).
- Utilization of exploratory data analysis (EDA) for agricultural data insights.
- Implementation of machine learning models (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM) for crop prediction.
- Interactive data visualizations for in-depth agricultural condition analysis.
- K-Means clustering for identifying similar groups of crops, aiding in crop rotation and soil management strategies.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
