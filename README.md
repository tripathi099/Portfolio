## Projects

### Beats Externship - Consumer Insights Analysis
**Description**: This project was completed as part of an externship for Beats, focusing on consumer sentiment analysis using reviews from Amazon. The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze customer sentiment on Beats products and compares it with competitor brands.

- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, TextBlob
- **Key Skills**: Data Cleaning, Sentiment Analysis, Visualization, Comparative Analysis
- **Repository Structure**:
  - `data/`: Contains the raw data files and cleaned datasets.
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data analysis and visualization code.
  - `README.md`: Detailed report on project objectives, methods, and findings.

**Highlights**:
- Extracted and cleaned over 1,000 product reviews for Beats and competitors.
- Performed sentiment analysis to gauge positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
- Visualized comparative sentiment scores between Beats and key competitors.

### Smart Farming - Crop Recommendation System
**Description**: This project focuses on a machine learning-based Crop Recommendation System designed to help farmers optimize crop productivity by analyzing soil properties and environmental conditions.

- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Key Skills**: EDA, Predictive Modeling, K-Means Clustering, Data Visualization
- **Repository Structure**:
  - `data/`: Contains the dataset of soil and environmental factors.
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the analysis and model implementation.
  - `README.md`: Comprehensive project report with insights from EDA and modeling.

**Highlights**:
- Conducted EDA to understand soil and weather conditions affecting crop yield.
- Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM for crop prediction, achieving high accuracy.
- Applied K-Means Clustering for crop classification, aiding in precision farming and crop rotation planning.

### Telco Customer Churn - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Description**: This project analyzes the Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify factors contributing to customer churn, with a focus on understanding customer demographics, service subscriptions, and account details.

- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
