Mrs. Peabody laughed. \"You're a funny dog, Barnaby,\" she said, \"but I think I'll have to invest in a sock drawer with a lock!\"\n","\n","Barnaby, satisfied with the outcome, curled up on his sock pile and napped, dreaming of fluffy socks and a date-less Mrs. Peabody. \n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Function to analyze reviews using Gemini AI\n","def analyze_reviews(reviews, api_key):\n","    genai.configure(api_key=api_key)\n","\n","    model = genai.GenerativeModel(\n","        model_name=\"gemini-1.5-flash\",\n","        generation_config={\n","            \"temperature\": 1,\n","            \"top_p\": 0.95,\n","            \"top_k\": 64,\n","            \"max_output_tokens\": 8192,\n","            \"response_mime_type\": \"text/plain\",\n","        },\n","    )\n","\n","    chat_session = model.start_chat(history=[])\n","\n","    # Customize the prompt to analyze customer sentiments\n","    prompt = \"Analyze the following reviews and summarize the key points:\\n\\n\" + \"\\n\\n\".join(reviews)\n","    response = chat_session.send_message(prompt)\n","    return response.text\n","\n","# Select a subset of reviews to analyze (first 5 for testing)\n","reviews = df['content'].head(5).tolist()\n","\n","# Run the analysis\n","api_key = \"AIzaSyC0BBKe0tiHVe8JvrqQ1u8TsqCn30oQoJs\"\n","insights = analyze_reviews(reviews, api_key)\n","print(insights)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":575},"id":"s6wtKFFIoycY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730211435369,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4227,"user":{"displayName":"Shivendra Tripathi","userId":"17323240907511247507"}},"outputId":"c48d5939-60ce-4d58-a6c0-1534b7d088dc"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["## 1More ComfoBuds Mini Reviews Summary:\n","\n","**Overall:** The 1More ComfoBuds Mini earbuds receive mixed reviews, with praise for their small size, comfort, and sleep-focused features, but also significant concerns about quality control issues and limited customization options.\n","\n","**Positives:**\n","\n","* **Small size and comfort:**  Reviewers consistently highlight the earbuds' incredibly small size and lightweight design, making them extremely comfortable for long periods, especially for sleeping.\n","* **Sleep-focused features:** The flat shape, ambient sounds library, and sleep timer make these earbuds ideal for blocking out noises while sleeping.\n","* **Good ANC:** While not the best on the market, the ANC is effective at reducing ambient noise, especially for sleep.\n","* **Decent sound quality:** Most reviewers agree that the sound is decent, particularly after using the Sound ID feature to customize it. \n","* **Good touch controls:** The touch controls are customizable and responsive, with no accidental button presses.\n","* **Excellent wind noise cancellation:** The wind reduction mode is highly praised for its effectiveness.\n","* **Small and convenient case:** The case is praised for its small size, wireless charging capabilities, and strong magnet closure.\n","\n","**Negatives:**\n","\n","* **Quality control issues:** Multiple reviewers reported experiencing the same problem with one or both earbuds losing their noise-cancelling ability after a short period of use, resulting in whooshing or roaring noises.
